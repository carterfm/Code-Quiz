            Since it seems easier that creating and appending children, then removing them,
            I'm just going to go ahead and create a series of sections/divs that will be 
            hidden and revealed based on user input.

            In broad strokes, before I do any CSS to work out the formatting, here's what
            I'm thinking:
            
            - Header (always present except when High Scores shown)
                - View High Scores
                - Time: X (0 by default, ticks down from 75 when in quiz, freezes on all)
            - Welcome section (present before and after a quiz + potential look at high scores)
                - bold h1 with title
                - P with description
                - start button
            - Quiz section
                - bold h2 with question
                - ol
                    - 4 list items with answer choices--buttons, essentially
            - Finished quiz section
                - bold h2 saying user is done
                - p displaying final score
                - 
        -->
        <!-- Test code from early on<header>
            <h2 class="test">Testing</h2>
            <button id="reveal">Press to reveal hidden h2</button>
        </header>-->

        <header>
            <p id="score-link">View High Scores</p>
            <p>Time left: <span id="countdown"></span></p>
        </header>
        
        <section id="welcome-screen">
            <h1>Coding Quiz Challenge</h1>
            <p>Try to answer the following code-related questions within the time limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers will penalize your score/time by ten seconds!</p>
            <button class="button" id="start-button">Start Quiz</button>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="end-screen">
            <h2>All done!</h2>
            <p>You final score is <span id="final-score"></span></p>
