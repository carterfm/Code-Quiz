# <Code-Quiz>
A timed coding quiz meant to help drill information that will be relevant for tech job interviews. This app dynamically hides and reveals page elements to the user as they navigate the quiz. The user is told if the answer they select is right or wrong, and incorrect answers deduct ten seconds from their remaining time to complete the quiz. Upon completion of the quiz, the user has the option to add their score to a list of high scores that is stored to local storage and rendered in a High Scores section of the app.
